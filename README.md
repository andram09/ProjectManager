This is a React-based web application created to simplify project and task management. Users can easily create projects by specifying a title, description, and deadline, with all projects displayed in a sidebar for quick navigation. Within each project, tasks can be added or removed, and users can switch between projects to view or edit details.

State management relies on useState, handling the list of projects, the selected project, and associated tasks. A custom modal system ensures data validation, providing immediate feedback for any errors during project creation.

The interface is styled with Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and clarity. With its straightforward design and useful features, the application makes managing projects simple and effective.
